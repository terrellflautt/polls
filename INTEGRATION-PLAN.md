- All apps share the same Stripe subscription
- Authentication works across all 4 apps
- Unified billing portal

**Database:**
- Polls can use existing DynamoDB tables or dedicated tables
- User data syncs across all apps
- Subscription status stored centrally

**Status:** Awaiting implementation
**Priority:** Medium (after snapitforms integration)
**Est. Time:** 4-6 hours for full integration
